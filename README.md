# STOCK PREDICTION IN NSE/BSE USING MACHINE LEARNING

The purpose of a "Prediction of Stocks In NSE/BSE using ML model" project is to 
develop a machine learning model that can make predictions about the future prices of 
stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange 
(BSE) in India or any other similar stock exchanges worldwide.



## Features

1. High Accuracy Predictions: Developed machine learning models that consistently achieve high accuracy rates in predicting stock movements in both NSE and BSE markets. 

2. Robust Performance Across Multiple Stocks: Demonstrated the effectiveness of our models across a diverse range of stocks, indicating their robustness and generalizability. 

3. Feature Engineering Excellence: Implemented advanced feature engineering 
techniques to extract meaningful insights from raw stock data, enhancing the predictive power of our models. 

4. Scalability and Efficiency: Designed scalable and efficient algorithms, enabling seamless processing of large volumes of data for quick and reliable predictions.

5. User-Friendly Interface: Developed a user-friendly interface or API for easy integration with trading platforms or investment tools, making our predictions accessible to a wider 
audience.
