# STOCK PREDICTION IN NSE/BSE USING MACHINE LEARNING

The purpose of a "Prediction of Stocks In NSE/BSE using ML model" project is to 
develop a machine learning model that can make predictions about the future prices of 
stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange 
(BSE) in India or any other similar stock exchanges worldwide.
